/*
 * Future work:
 * We didn't have enough time to fully implement all the features.
 * 
 * - Robot armature using IK
 * - A NavMesh agent for baseline for both the VR robot and the Game physics robot
 * - A database for storing data
 * - A maze environment
 * - different, more elevated environment, more 'natural' scenarios
 * - multiple agents, a multiplayer system
 * - remote controlled from another building/location, simulate bomb diffusal for example
 * - Room scanning using photgrammetry tech from another project
